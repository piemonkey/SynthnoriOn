# Synthnori-on

A synthesiser Tenori-on written using [Processing](https://processing.org/).

Click the squares to turn on the lights, each vertical line is played in turn.
Each horizontal line controls a different pitch synthesiser, all using the same
settings from the left.

This was made as a project for the "Creative Programming for Digital Media &
Mobile Apps" course from [Goldsmiths, University of London on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/london)
and is heavily modified from one of their examples.
